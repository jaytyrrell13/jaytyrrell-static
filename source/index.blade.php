    <p>I'm originally from Pompano Beach, Florida but have lived in the New York area since May, 2012. I am currently living in Brooklyn but previously lived in Jersey City for almost two years.</p>

    <p>In October, 2010 I started working at EDB Solutions. My responsibilities included designing and coding client sites for small businesses located nationwide. When I moved to New York, I continued working remotely until the end of July.</p>

    <p>In December of that year, I started part-time as an intern at CourseHorse. My responsibilities included creating newsletters and testing the site for quality assurance. After about a month, I also started working part-time as a QA Engineer at MEV. In August, 2013 I decided to join full-time as Software Engineer at CourseHorse. My responsibilities included building/deploying new features, developing tools to make development more efficient, and fixing bugs.</p>

    <p>In February, 2016 I started working at AbleTo.</p>
